## Background story

The effect of social media companies on the moral and political landscape in
our nations is getting stronger day-by-day. A very recent example can be seen in
Nepal, where [the new leader was elected via Discord](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/policy/nepals-gen-z-picks-new-leader-on-discord-crypto-community-in-shock).

In this example, a company within the hypothetical country of Y wants to start an
alternative to YouTube. This alternative is intended to serve the same function
while keeping the control of the platform in sovereign hands outside the reach
of foreign interests.
